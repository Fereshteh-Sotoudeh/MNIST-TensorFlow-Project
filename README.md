## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Normalizes pixel values to improve model efficiency.
- **Neural Network Architecture**:
  - Input Layer: Flattens 28x28 images into a 1D array of 784 features.
  - Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
  - Dropout: Reduces overfitting.
  - Output Layer: 10 neurons (one per digit) with softmax activation.
- **Performance Visualization**:
  - Training/Validation Accuracy & Loss plots.
  - Test Predictions with True Labels.
